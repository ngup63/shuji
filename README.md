## Background for the name

The name of the project is for honouring the legacy of a certain master from the Ryukyu archipelago who contributed to the martial arts that we today know as **karate** and **ryukyu kobujutsu**.

## Getting started

Install the `shuji` command line utility globally with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
Elevated privileges might be needed via `sudo`, depending on the platform. In most cases just:

```sh
npm install ngup63/shuji -g
```

Usage example:

```sh
shuji file.js.map -o folder -p
```

Please note that the minimum supported version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is `14.15.0`, which is [the active Long Term Support (LTS) version](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule).

## Command line options

The output of `shuji --help` pretty much covers all the options:

```sh
shuji - Reverse engineering JavaScript and CSS sources from sourcemaps
Usage: shuji [options] <file|directory>

  -h, --help               Help and usage instructions
  -o, --output-dir String  Output directory - default: .
  -p, --preserve           Preserve sourcemap's original folder structure.
  -M, --match String       Regular expression for matching and filtering files -
                           default: \.map$
  -v, --verbose            Verbose output, will print which file is currently being
                           processed
  -V, --version            Version number

Version 0.6.1
```

## Testing

Test files are generated with [UglifyJS 3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js) and
[`sass`](https://sass-lang.com/install)
by using files from the [stretchy](https://github.com/LeaVerou/stretchy) project,
with the following commands:

```sh
uglifyjs stretchy.js --compress --mangle \
 --output stretchy.min.js --source-map includeSources
mv stretchy.min.js.map stretchy-with-sources.min.js.map

uglifyjs stretchy.js --compress --mangle \
 --output stretchy.min.js --source-map "url=inline"
mv stretchy.min.js stretchy-inline-sources.min.js

uglifyjs stretchy.js --compress --mangle \
 --output stretchy.min.js --source-map "url=stretchy.min.js.map"

sass stretchy.scss:stretchy.css

sass stretchy.scss:stretchy-inline.css --embed-source-map
```

Unit tests are written with [`tape`](https://github.com/substack/tape) and can be executed with `npm test`.
Code coverage is inspected with [`nyc`](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) and
can be executed with `npm run coverage` after running `npm test`.
Please make sure it is over 90% at all times.
